# Welcome to the Eclipse Oniro Mirrors

This space mirrors all repositories from [the OpenHarmony organization at gitee](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs). These mirrored repositories are **read-only** and consumed by Eclipse Oniro build system.

The objective of this mirroring is to enhance the speed and reliability of accessing these repositories. It also streamlines the process of forking and integration with GitHub. To ensure these mirrors are consistently up-to-date, a synchronization CI workflow is executed every 24 hours to incorporate the latest changes.

For those involved in active development and wishing to contribute, please visit [the Eclipse Oniro for OpenHarmony](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony) space.
