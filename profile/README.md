# Welcome to the Eclipse Oniro Mirrors

This project mirrors all repositories from the [OpenHarmony
organization](https://gitee.com/openharmony) at gitee (https://gitee.com/).

These mirrors are read-only and consumed by [Eclipse Oniro](https://oniroproject.org/). For ongoing development please check our Eclipse Oniro for OpenHarmony [project](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony).

The purpose of mirroring these repositories is to improve repository access
speed and reliability, as well as, allowing easier forking and consumption on
GitHub. A mirror sync CI workflow is run every 24h to receive the latest changes.
