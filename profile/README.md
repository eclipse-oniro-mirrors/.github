# Welcome to the Eclipse Oniro Mirrors

This space mirrors the repositories from the [OpenHarmony organization at gitcode](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/). These mirrored repositories are **read-only** and consumed by Eclipse Oniro build system.

The objective of this mirroring is to enhance the speed and reliability of accessing these repositories. It also streamlines the process of forking and integration with GitHub. To ensure these mirrors are consistently up-to-date, a synchronization CI workflow is executed every 24 hours to incorporate the latest changes. The GitHub CI workflows responsible for the mirroring can be found in the [mirror-sync repository](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro-mirrors/mirror-sync/).

For those involved in active development and wishing to contribute, please visit [the Eclipse Oniro for OpenHarmony](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony) space.
